## Hey There !!

Hello world. I'm Vishal, a 3rd yr CSE undergrad from Chennai, India. While most people generally pick up a topic, or a concept (like say Computer Vision, Big Data, or just Algorithms), understand it and aspire to excel at it... I fell in love with a language, Python. As someone who has started out by learning C++ in school, learning Python was as easy as surprising. The speed at which I could translate ideas to code was amazing, and oh boy, all I wanted to do was make things, write simple scripts to automate everyday tasks. And hence I continued to explore Python, the countless modules and possibilities with Python. I went to Hackathons, won some but more importantly made something that others could use. And I guess that's always been my mantra for programming and my way to "help the world" : Make cool stuff.
