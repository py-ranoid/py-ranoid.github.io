Do you 
- need your own site ?
- need your own site with a blog ? 
- need your own site with a blog but can't code front-end ?


Welcome to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 
It lets you "transform your plain text into static websites and blogs".

# How to create your own (version of this) site
## Setting up Github Pages
- Create a [Github](www.github.com) account if you don't have one.
- Create a repository called `<username>.github.io`.<br>Note : By default, the contents of the github page for your repository will be sourced from its README. 
- This lets you use Github Pages to host static webpages (fixed content)
- Clone the repository on your local machine with 
    
    ```git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git```

## Getting this theme
- Find a [Jekyll theme](http://drjekyllthemes.github.io/) that works for you. Each theme has a link to its source code and emo below it.
- If you'd like to use the theme I'm using, check out the demo [her](http://koppl.in/indigo/). Though isn't my site one :laughing: ?
- Show sergiokopplin some ‚ù§Ô∏è by adding a ‚≠êÔ∏è to his [repository](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo)
- Clone the repository on your local machine with 

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo.git```

## Hosting your Jekyll site
- Optional : If you'd like to experiment with your site before you push it, make a branch with `git checkout -b beta`. However you can only host your github page from the `master` branch so all your changes from `beta` will have to be merged into `master`. 
- Copy the theme files to your GH pages folder (after cloning)

    ```
    cd username.github.io
    cp ../indigo/* -r .
    ```
- Add, commit and push your changes to github.

    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added theme files"
    git push origin master  
    ```
- Note : Github Pages take some time to render so don't expect your pushed changes to reflect immediately on your site. üòõ

## Running the site on your local machine
- Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), [Bundler](https://bundler.io/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and other dependencies. 
- Serve site with jekyll
  

```
sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev build-essential
# sudo apt-get install ruby`ruby -e 'puts RUBY_VERSION[/\d+\.\d+/]'`-dev\n
# Run ‚¨ÜÔ∏è if you ‚¨áÔ∏è doesn't word
sudo gem install eventmachine -v '1.2.7'
gem install jekyll bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config-dev.yml
```
- If it all works fine üëå , your site should now be running on port [4000](http://localhost:4000/).

## Tweaking your site
- Most of the elements on your homepage can be edited with `_config.yml`. Comments in the file should guide you through the rest of the process. 
- However, changes made to `_config.yml` are not updated dynamically and the the server should be restarted.
- The **About** section can be edited at `/about.md`
- On the other hand, modifying other files and assets, dynamiccally updates your site. For example, this blog gets rendered on my local site as I write it 

```    
    Regenerating: 1 file(s) changed at 2018-09-23 10:08:23
                    _posts/2018-09-23-init.markdown
                    ...done in 1.246159402 seconds.
```
- Again, once you're done making changes, make sure you add, commit and push your changes to GitHub.

## Creating a blog
- Blogs are automatically generated from markdown files in `/_posts`, which contains all blog posts. 
- Blog filename format : `yyyy-mm-dd-title.markdown`
    - `yyyy-mm-dd` : Date of the blog
    - `title` : Title of the blog with no space. Can have multiple hyphens instead. For example : `yyyy-mm-dd-new-blog.markdown`
    - Note : The title also becomes the URL of the blog. So link the above file would be `/new-blog`
- Blog content format : `yyyy-mm-dd-title.markdown`
    - Every blog has a header (which is more a config) and content of your blog.
    - For example `2018-09-23-template.markdown` is the  source for [this blog](http://vishalgupta.me/template/) and contains : 

        ```

        More **markdown** content

        ---

        ```
        

        - `hidden` : If `true`, post won't get indexed under at `/blog`
        - `tags` : List of tags for your blog. You can search for other blogs with the tag at `/tags/#tagname`
        - `category` : used to suggest other blogs (in `/posts`) with the same category
        - `projects` : If `true`, post will get indexed under at `/projects`
