Do you 
- need your own site ?
- need your own site with a blog ? 
- need your own site with a blog but can't code front-end ?

Welcome to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 
It lets you "transform your plain text into static websites and blogs".

## How to create your own (version of this) site
### Step 1 : Setting up Github Pages
- Create a [Github](www.github.com) account if you don't have one.
- Create a repository called `<username>.github.io`.
- This lets you use Github Pages to host static webpages (fixed content)
- Clone the repository on your local machine with 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git
    ```

### Step - 2 : Getting a/this theme
- Find a [Jekyll theme](http://drjekyllthemes.github.io/) that works for you. Each theme has a link to its source code and emo below it.
- If you'd like to use the theme I'm using, check out the [demo](http://koppl.in/indigo/) though isn't my site one :laughing: ?
- Show sergiokopplin some ❤️ by adding a ⭐️ to the [repository](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo)
- Clone the repository on your local machine with 
  ```
  https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo.git
  ```
### Step - 3 : Hosting your Jekyll site
- Optional : If you'd like to experiment with your site before you push it, make a branch with `git checkout -b beta`. However you can only host your github page from the `master` branch so all your changes from `beta` will have to be merged into `master`. 
- Copy the theme files to your GH pages folder (after cloning)
    ```
    cd username.github.io
    cp ../indigo/* -r .
    ```
- Add, commit and push your changes to github.
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added theme files"
    git push origin master  
    ```
