Host to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain peak and the endangered Red Panda, Sikkim is a state in northeastern India. Nestled between Nepal, Tibet (China), Bhutan and West Bengal (India), the state offers a smorgasbord of cultures and cuisines. That said, it’s hardly surprising that the old spice route meanders through western Sikkim, connecting Lhasa with the ports of Bengal. Although the latter could also be attributed to cardamom (*kali elaichi*), a perennial herb native to Sikkim, which the state is the second-largest producer of, globally. Lastly, having been to and lived in India, all my life, I can confidently say Sikkim is one of the cleanest & safest regions in India, making it ideal for first-time backpackers.

## Brief History
  * **17th century** : Kingdom of Sikkim is founded by the Namgyal dynasty and ruled by Buddhist priest-kings known as the Chogyal.
  * **1890** : Sikkim becames a princely state of British India.
  * **1947** :
    * Sikkim continues its protectorate status with the Union of India, post Indian-independence.
    * This enabled the Chogyal to preserve autonomy and shape a "model Asian state" whose the literacy rate and per capita income were twice as high as neighbouring Nepal, Bhutan and India
  * **1973** : Anti-royalist riots take place in front of the Chogyal's palace, by Nepalis seekking greater representation.
  * **1975** :
    * Prime Minister of Sikkim appeals to the Indian Parliament for Sikkim to become a state of India
    * Indian Army takes over the city of Gangtok and disarms the Chogyal's palace guards
    * Referendum leads to the deposition of the monarchy and Sikkim joins India as its 22nd state. -->

      <li>However, Buddhism is said to have reached Sikkim only in the 17th century with the arrival of three Tibetan monks viz. Rigdzin Goedki Demthruchen, Mon Kathok Sonam Gyaltshen & Rigdzin Legden Je at Yuksom. Together, they established a Buddhist monastery.</li>
      <li>In 1642 they crowned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phuntsog_Namgyal">Phuntsog Namgyal</a> as the first monarch of Sikkim and gave him the title of Chogyal, or Dharma Raja.</li>

* Gangtok, being the capital, is easiest to reach amongst other regions, by public transport and shared cabs.
* By Air:
    * [Pakyong (PYG)](https://www.skyscanner.com/flights-to/pyg/cheap-flights-to-pakyong-airport.html) :
        * Nearest airport from Gangtok (about 1 hour away)
        * Tabletop airport
        * Reserved cabs cost around INR 1200.
        * As of Apr 2021, the only flights to PYG are from IGI (Delhi) and CCU (Kolkata).
    * [Bagdogra (IXB)](https://www.skyscanner.com/flights-to/ixb/cheap-flights-to-bagdogra-airport.html) :
        * About 20 minutes from Siliguri and 4 hours from Gangtok.
        * Larger airport with flights to most major Indian cities.
        * Reserved cabs cost about INR 3000. Shared cabs cost about INR 350.
* By Train:
    * [New Jalpaiguri (NJP)](https://www.irctc.co.in/nget/train-search) :
        * About 20 minutes from Siliguri and 4 hours from Gangtok.
        * Reserved cabs cost about INR 3000. Shared cabs from INR 350.
* By Road:
    * NH10 connects Siliguri to Gangtok
    * If you can’t find [buses](https://www.redbus.in/) plying to Gangtok directly, reach Siliguri and then take a cab to Gangtok.
* Sikkim Nationalised Transport Div. also runs hourly buses between [Siliguri and Gangtok](https://www.sntd.in/PDF/DailyBusScheduleSiliguri.pdf) and daily buses on [other common routes](https://www.sntd.in/PDF/BusSchedule.pdf). They’re cheaper than shared cabs.
* [Wizzride](https://wizzride.com/) also operates shared cabs between Siliguri/Bagdogra/NJP, Gangtok and Darjeeling. They cost about the same as shared cabs but pack in half as many people in “luxury cars” (Innova, Xylo, etc.) and are hence more comfortable.

    <h3> Exploring Gangtok on an MTB </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If you&#39;d like to explore Gangtok at your own pace, you could rent a cycle from Hub Outdoor or HillBike. I paid INR 600 for a day at HillBike.</li>
      <li>These are well-maintained geared mountain bikes, so adapting to inclines and declines should be a breeze, even for beginners.</li>
      <li>Cycling down from Ganesh Tok to Tashi View Point is an absolute delight and in my opinion, the best thing you can do in Gangtok.</li>
      <li>While it is a little unconventional and exhausting (uphill stretches), but a 100% recommended unless you’ve been skipping leg day</li>
      <li>Pro tip : Make sure you use the right/back brake while decelerating downhill and not the left/front brake.</li>
      <li>Recommended route [3-5hrs, 20.3Km, 1770-2081ft] : <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Hill+Bike,+White+Hall,+Chandmari+Rd,+Mintokgang,+Gangtok,+Sikkim+737101/Sera+Jhe+Dro-Phen-Ling+Monastery,+Chandmari,+Gangtok,+Sikkim/Ganesh+Tok,+Gangtok,+Sikkim/Tashi+View+Point,+Gangtok,+Sikkim+737107/Bakthang+Waterfall,+Gangtok,+Sikkim/Vajra+World,+Sungava,+Gangtok,+Sikkim/Tsuglakhang+Monastery+%26+Temple,+Secretariat+Road,+Vishal+Gaon,+Gangtok,+Sikkim/Enchey+Monastery,+Gangtok,+Sikkim/Hill+Bike,+Chandmari+Road,+Mintokgang,+Gangtok,+Sikkim/@27.348483,88.6027428,14z/data=!4m56!4m55!1m5!1m1!1s0x39e6a541bb664a77:0x6380b5a7d5e40dfd!2m2!1d88.6177688!2d27.3334401!1m5!1m1!1s0x39e6a50df792a11d:0x5b40589f4f9a9cd9!2m2!1d88.6211324!2d27.3354864!1m5!1m1!1s0x39e6a545a3b82427:0x515985606a70bdc4!2m2!1d88.6212921!2d27.3414249!1m5!1m1!1s0x39e6bab8e929765b:0x8c84f54b470e61dc!2m2!1d88.616133!2d27.3706406!1m5!1m1!1s0x39e6bab27d45e03d:0x183098da745929f0!2m2!1d88.6235499!2d27.3578061!1m5!1m1!1s0x39e6a56ea7511909:0xaa5acc5f8a224244!2m2!1d88.6096575!2d27.3371364!1m5!1m1!1s0x39e6a56b528b2555:0xe4c7def8a2cce766!2m2!1d88.6147222!2d27.3261111!1m5!1m1!1s0x39e6ba848fe4b38f:0xf1c23957008e31e8!2m2!1d88.6191659!2d27.3359368!1m5!1m1!1s0x39e6a541bb664a77:0x6380b5a7d5e40dfd!2m2!1d88.6177688!2d27.3334401!3e0">Chandmari (HillBike) -&gt; Sera Jhe Dro-Phen-Ling Monastery —&gt; Ganesh Tok —&gt; Tashi View Point —&gt; Bakthung Falls —&gt; Vajra Stand —&gt; Tsuklakhang Palace &amp; Monastery —&gt; Enchey Monastery —&gt; Chandmari</a></li>

# North Sikkim
* The easiest & most economical way to explore North Sikkim is the 3D/2N package offered by shared-cab drivers.
* This includes food, permits, cab rides and accommodation (1N in Lachen and 1N in Lachung)
* The accommodation on both nights are at homestays with bare necessities, so keep your hopes low.
* In the spirit of sustainable tourism, you’ll be asked to discard single-use plastic bottles, so please carry a bottle that you can refill along the way.
* Zero Point and Gurdongmer Lake are snow-capped throughout the year

# East Sikkim

### Zuluk and Silk Route
* **Time needed: 2D/1N**
* Zuluk [9,400ft] is a small hamlet with an excellent view of the eastern Himalayan range including the Kanchenjunga.
* Was once a transit point to the historic Silk Route from Tibet (Lhasa) to India (West Bengal).
* The drive from Gangtok to Zuluk takes at least four hours. Hence, it makes sense to spend the night at a homestay and space out your trip to Zuluk

# Darjeeling
* In my opinion, Darjeeling is lovely for a two-day detour on your way back to Bagdogra/Siliguri and not any longer (unless you’re a Bengali couple on a honeymoon)
* Once a part of Sikkim, Darjeeling was ceded to the East India Company after a series of wars, with Sikkim briefly receiving a grant from EIC for “gifting” Darjeeling to the latter
* Post-independence, Darjeeling was merged with the state of West Bengal.

## Itinerary

### Day 1 :
* Take a cab from [Gangtok to Darjeeling](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Gangtok/Darjeeling/) (shared-cabs cost INR 300 per seat)
* Reach Darjeeling by noon and check in to your Hostel. I stayed at [Hideout](https://www.booking.com/hotel/in/hideout-backpackers-hostel.en-gb.html).
* Spend the evening visiting either a monastery (or the Batasia Loop), Nehru Road and Mall Road.
* Grab dinner at [Glenary](https://www.google.com/search?q=glenary%27s+darjeeling) whilst listening to live music.

    <li>Alternatively, if you don’t want to get up at 4am or shell out INR1500 on the cab to Tiger Hill, walk to the Kanchenjunga View Point down Mall Road</li>
    <li>Next, queue up outside <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kevs+darjeeling">Keventers</a> for breakfast with a view in a century-old cafe</li>
    <li>Get a cab at Gandhi Road and visit a tea garden (Happy Valley is the closest) and the Ropeway. I was lucky to meet 6 other backpackers at my hostel and we ended up pooling the cab at INR 200 per person, with INR 1400 being on the expensive side, but you could bargain.</li>
    <li>Get lunch, buy some tea at Golden Tips, pack your bags and hop on a shared-cab back to Siliguri. It took us about 4hrs to reach Siliguri, with an hour to spare before my train.</li>
    <li>If you’ve still got time on your hands, then check out the Peace Pagoda and the <a href="http://dhr.in.net">Darjeeling Himalayan Railway</a> (Toy Train). At <a href="http://dhr.in.net/fare-details.php">INR 1500</a>, I found the latter to be too expensive and skipped it.</li>

# Tips and hacks
* Download [offline maps](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6291838), especially when you’re exploring Northern Sikkim.
* Food and booze are the cheapest in Gangtok. Stash up before heading to other regions.
* Keep your Aadhar/Passport handy since you need [permits to travel to North & East Sikkim](https://sikkimtourism.gov.in/Public/TravellerEssentials/pap).
* In rural areas and some cafes, you may get to try Rhododendron Wine, made from [Rhododendron arboreum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhododendron_arboreum) a.k.a Gurans. Its production is a little hush-hush since the flower is considered holy and is also the National Flower of Nepal.
* If you don’t want to invest in a new jacket, boots or a pair of gloves, you can always rent them at nominal rates from your hotel or little stores around tourist sites.
* Check the weather of a region before heading there. Low visibility and precipitation can quite literally dampen your experience.
* Keep your itinerary flexible to accommodate for rest and impromptu plans.
* Shops and restaurants close by 8pm in Sikkim and Darjeeling. Plan for the same.


### Carry…
*  a couple of extra pairs of socks (woollen, if possible)
* a pair of slippers to wear indoors
* a reusable water bottle
* an umbrella
* a power bank
* a couple of tablets of Diamox. Helps deal with altitude sickness
* extra clothes and wet bags since you may not get a chance to wash/dry your clothes
* a few passport size photographs

### Shared-cab hacks
* Intercity rides can be exhausting. If you can afford it, pay for an additional seat.
* Call shotgun on the drives beyond Lachen and Lachung. The views are breathtaking.
* Return cabs tend to be cheaper (WB cabs travelling from SK and vice-versa)

### Cost
* My median daily expenditure (back when I went to Sikkim in early March 2021) was INR 1350.
* This includes stay (bunk bed), food, wine and transit (shared cabs)
* In my defence, I splurged on food, wine and extra seats in shared cabs, but if you’re on a budget, you could easily get by on INR 1 - 1.2k per day.
* For a 9-day trip, I ended up shelling out nearly INR 15k, including 2AC trains to & from Kolkata
* Note : Summer (March to May) and Autumn (October to December) are peak seasons, and thereby more expensive to travel around.
